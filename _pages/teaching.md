### Courses at Northwestern University

### ME 327/CEE 327: Finite Elements Methods in Mechanics
- **Quarter:** Fall 2025
- **Level:** Undergraduate / Graduate
- **Prerequisites:** Basic computer programming (in Python) and basic linear algebra.
- **Tools & Software:** Python (NumPy, scikit-learn), Abaqus, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Format:** Lectures + Hands-on Labs
- **Delivery:** In-person
- **Course Description:** This course provides a practical introduction to the Finite Element Method (FEM), with an emphasis on hands-on implementation using Python. It covers the basic theoretical concepts necessary to understand and apply FEM, without going into extensive mathematical detail. Students will learn how to build FEM solvers with minimal external dependencies and how to use a general-purpose framework (Abaqus). The course focuses on solving elliptic partial differential equations, with applications in heat conduction, linear elasticity, and potential flow, covering a broad range of topics relevant to students of civil and mechanical engineering.
