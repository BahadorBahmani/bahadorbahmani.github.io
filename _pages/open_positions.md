If you are a current student at Northwestern and are interested in gaining research experience in computational mechanics and/or machine learning, please feel free to reach out. 
We have several ongoing projects that you can contribute to, and we are also open to co-designing a new research project that excites both you and our group. 
Prior research experience is not required—enthusiasm and commitment are far more important. 
You are welcome to stop by my office to discuss opportunities, or you can email me a short paragraph about your research interests along with your CV or resume.
