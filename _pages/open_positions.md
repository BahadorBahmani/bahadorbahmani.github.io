## Undergraduate and Master's Students

<div style="text-align: justify;">
If you are a current student at Northwestern and are interested in gaining research experience in computational mechanics and/or machine learning, please feel free to reach out. 
We have several ongoing projects that you can contribute to, and we are also open to co-designing a new research project that excites both you and our group. 
Prior research experience is not requiredâ€”enthusiasm and commitment are far more important. 
You are welcome to stop by my office to discuss opportunities, or you can email me a short paragraph about your research interests along with your CV or resume.
